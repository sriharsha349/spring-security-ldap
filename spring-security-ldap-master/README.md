# Spring Security LDAP Authentication
In this article, we secured our spring APIs with spring security LDAP authentication. To do so, we created two custom roles as ADMIN and USER. We used ldif file for the textual representation of LDAP and used in-memory LDAP server UnboundId for this tutorial. We also defined our custom password encoder and used Bcrypt with it.
